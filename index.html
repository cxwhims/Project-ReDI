                    <p>A dish that's fallen out of favour and then become popular again more times than we can count, beef Wellington's origins are as unclear as its connection to Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington. Traditionally, it's a beef fillet steak, coated in pâté and mushroom duxelles (an extremely finely chopped mixture of mushrooms, shallots and herbs), wrapped in puff pastry, then baked. <a href="#"> -- Recipes -- </a> </p>

                    <div class="other"><img src="/Project-ReDI/img/sauerbraten.jpg" alt="sauerbraten" class="dish"><p>Sauerbraten, the German national dish, is a pot roast made of beef rump that’s traditionally marinated for days in a mixture of vinegar or red wine (or both), water, herbs and spices. It's then served with a rich, sweet-sour gravy. Many people think the meal dates back as far as Charlemagne himself in the 9th century, while other documents say that Julius Caesar was the inspiration behind the dish – it's believed he sent amphoras filled with beef marinated in wine to the new Roman colony of Cologne.<br> <a href="#"> -- Recipes -- </a> </p></div>

There are countless methods of preparing and cooking the duck, but originally it was roasted in a closed oven until the kitchens of the Qing Dynasty developed the open-oven style to cook several ducks at the same time. The duck is then served with steamed Chinese pancakes, cucumber, spring onion and sweet bean sauce.<br> <a href="#"> -- Recipes -- </a> </p></div>

It's thought that a version of the soup has existed since at least Roman times, but the modern version originated in 18th-century Paris. The soup is served in a ramekin, topped with a slice of baguette and cheese that's then melted under a grill.<br> <a href="#"> -- Recipes -- </a> </p></div>
